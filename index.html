        <h2>Band Bio:</h2>
        
        <p>
            Lacuna Coil is a gothic metal band from Milan, Italy.  Since their formation in 1994, the group has had two name changes, being previously known as Sleep of Right, and Ethereal.
            Inspired by the combination of gothic imagery and music, the members have been known, musically, for composing mid-tempo songs
            consisting of prominent guitar lines and contrasting dual female/male vocal harmonies to help create a melodic, detached sound.
            Much of the band's recent material, however, sees a heavier and more down-tuned style, featuring a more distinct bass line and a higher
            mixing of the guitars within the songs.  The band's 2012 release, Dark Adrenaline, peaked at number 15 on the Billboard 200.  They toured
            internationally and were nominated in 2006 for an MTV Europe Music. (Wikipedia)
